# React Developer Recruitment Task 

## Description
Your job is to code an app with posts of users with ability to manage posts and comments. Application must be SPA and use multiple routes (listed below). 

## Tech stack:
* API: [API DOCS](https://graphqlzero.almansi.me/api) 
* GQL: [client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started/)
* Starter: [Create react app starter](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) - TS template
* Routing: [React-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router)
* Typescript: [DOCS](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

## Screens:
* `Homepage` 
    ![Homepage](img/HomePage.png)
    * List of users. 
    * For each user you must display his details (you can omit the address). 
    * On user click you will redirect to `User Details` page
* `User Details`
    ![User Details](img/UserDetails.png)
    * This page contains the user name at the top of the page.
    * List of user posts (just titles trimmed to one line).
    * On click on the post item you will redirect to `Post Details` page
    * Button that on click will open the  `Add post modal`. 
    * Back button that will go back to `Homepage`
* `Post Details`
    ![User Details](img/PostDetails.png)
    ![User Details comments](img/PostDetailsComments.png)
    * On top of the page you still have the username
    * Post full details 
    * Button to remove post. 
    * On remove you will have to go back to `User Details` page and remove current post from the list and API.
    * Button/link for comments 'show/hide comments' that will toggle the comments list visibility.
    * Button to add comment.
    * Adding comments should be similar to `Add Post Modal` but contain different fields and action.
    * Back button that will go back to `Posts list
*  `Add Post/Comment Modal`
    ![Add Post Modal](img/AddPostModal.png)
    ![Add Comment Modal](img/AddCommentModal.png)
    *   Title
    *   Form fields
    *   Two buttons `Cancel`, `Save`
    *   Cancel will just close the modal and ignore changes
    *   Save will connect with API and add Comment/Post to the list

## Must-have:
1. React + Typescript
2. Connection with API (GQL)
3. Usage of react-router for multiple pages
4. Loaders when you wait for the data (react-skeleton)
5. Validation on forms
6. Usage of modern js functionality (ES6+)

## Good to have:
1. Clean code (linters, prettier)
2. UI kit for styles (or styled-components)
3. Tests
4. App deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

## What will we be paying attention to:
1. How you split code for components
2. How your manage your data.
3. Reusability of the components.
4. Code repetitions and reusability (keep your code [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) and simple [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle)).
5. How and where you put your business logic.
6. Code optimization and the solution&#39;s performance.
7. Working in accordance with good practices in general.
8. How you communicate with API.
9. Handling unexpected errors or potential exceptions.
